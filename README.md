# N-BodySimulation3
Simulates the gravitations forces between N-bodies, without dynamic collisions, the objects will absorb eachother when they collide moving as a single object. Change the G constant at the top of the program to edit the strength of the gravitational force. Use WASD to navigate around the space.
